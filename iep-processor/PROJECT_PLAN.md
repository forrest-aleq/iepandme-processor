## Architecture Overview

### 1. Document Processing Pipeline
```
Upload → Classification → Tiered Extraction → Validation → Storage → Date Extraction → Task Generation → Calendar Integration
```

### 2. Multi-Tenant Architecture
- **Schema-per-tenant approach** using Supabase RLS
- **Tenant isolation** via `app_metadata.tenant_id`
- **Private schemas** for sensitive operations

### 3. Subscription Model
- **Free Tier**: 3 document uploads
- **Paid Plans**: $20/month or $2/active IEP
- **Usage-based billing** with Stripe metered billing
